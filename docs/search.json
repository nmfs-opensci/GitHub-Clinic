In 2024, the GitHub Governance Team (GGT) provided a series of workshops to onboard NOAA Fisheries scientists to GitHub Enterprise and provide training in the use of Git and GitHub for NOAA Fisheries. In 2025, NMFS Open Science will be leading a second iteration of these workshops to provide NOAA Fisheries staff with the necessary skills to effectively incorporate Git and GitHub into existing workflows.\nThe GGT has outlined several use cases for why you may want to incorporate Git and GitHub into your workflows:",
