This also applies to templates that are built for use beyond your specific project.\n\nA lot of this is supplemented by useful issue tracking and pull requests."

A history full of “fix typo” or “oops” commits makes debugging a nightmare.\nSimplified Collaboration: A clean history makes it easier to understand the project’s evolution. When your team’s commits are well-organized and linear, it’s easier to review code, merge branches, and avoid conflicts. It reduces the cognitive load on every developer.\nClearer Project Narrative: Think of your Git history as a story of your project’s development. A clean, linear history tells how a project evolved. This is invaluable for new team members or contributors who need to get up to speed quickly."

You know it’s a recent change, but you don’t want to manually check each of the 20 commits made since then.\n# 1. Start the bisect session\ngit bisect start\n\n# 2.

Mark the last known working commit as 'good'\n#    (You can find this SHA using 'git log')\ngit bisect good 1a2b3c4\nGit will now check out a commit halfway between the good and bad commits. You then test the code. - If the code still has the bug, you run git bisect bad. - If the code works correctly, you run git bisect good. Git continues this process, cutting the number of commits in half each time, until it finds the first bad commit.\n# Git's final output:\n# 691e84a is the first bad commit\n# Author: First Last &lt;first.last@noaa.gov&gt;\n# Commit: a2f5b3a FIX: Corrected bug in natural mortality calculation\n\n# 4.

Refresh the instructions after 20 seconds to make sure everything updates properly.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Start the exercise\nAfter waiting the suggested 20 seconds, refresh the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI suggest moving the instructions tab into another window so you can work side-by-side with the instructions to limit switching back and forth between tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Follow the exercise\nIn this exercise, we will be demonstrating how to resolve a merge conflict. GitHub Actions has introduced a change to a file on a branch that conflicts with another branch. We’ll go through the process of merging that change in, creating the merge conflict, and fixing it.\n\nCreate a pull request\nSince merge conflicts occur when merging from a pull request, we’ll start by creating a new pull request.\n\nOn the Pull requests tab of the repository, open a new pull request by clicking the green New button. Keep main as the base branch, and set the compare branch to my-resume. Click the green Create pull request button.\n\nEnter “Resolving merge conflicts” as the title of the pull request, and click Create pull request.\n\nWait 20 seconds and refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\nResolve a merge conflict\n\nThe pull request we created has a conflict. Click the Resolve conflicts button in your pull request.\n\nLook for the line that starts with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; my-resume and ends with &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; main (it should be lines 5-9). These are your merge conflict indicators.\n\nNow we have to choose what to keep and what to get rid of. For this exercise, we’ll keep the changes made on the my-resume branch and remove the changes made on the main branch. Do this by deleting all content below the ======= and above &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; main (this should just be one line).\n\nDelete the merge conflict indicators on lines 5, 7, and 8 to retain only the change that was made on the my-resume branch.\n\nClick the Mark as resolved button in the upper right, and commit the merge.\n\nWait about 20 seconds and refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\nCreate your own conflict\nNow that we know how to resolve a merge conflict, let’s create one of our own to see how they may occur. The GitHub Actions bot added a new file to the main branch. We’ll create the same file in the my-resume branch that has different content.\n\nOn the Code tab, click the dropdown where it says main and switch to the my-resume branch.\n\nClick the Add file dropdown (it might look like a + if you’re in a condensed window) and create a new file. Name it references.md.\n\nAdd some content to the file. The content doesn’t really matter, as long as it’s different from the copy on main. Commit your changes directly to the my-resume branch with an appropriate commit message.\n\nWait 20 seconds and refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\nMerge your pull request\nOur commit created a merge conflict in our existing pull request. Let’s deal with that before we finalize our new merge.\n\nIn the Pull requests tab, open your “Resolving merge conflicts” merge request. Click the Resolve conflicts button at the bottom of the pull request.\n\nFollowing the instructions from above, resolve the merge conflict.\n\nMark the conflict as resolved, and commit your merge.\n\nMerge your pull request, and delete the my-resume branch.\n\nWait 20 seconds then refresh the instructions README page.\nYou’re finished with the tutorial! Feel free to experiment with creating and resolving merge conflicts to get comfortable with the process.",

    "text": "Working in GitHub Desktop - Tutorial\nTo get a bit more experience working with GitHub repositories, we are going to clone our tutorial repository, create a repository in GitHub Desktop, make a commit, and push our changes up to GitHub.\n\nStep 1: Log into GitHub\nIf this is your first time using GitHub Desktop, you will need to log in to your GitHub account. Open a browser window to GitHub, and make sure you’re logged in to your GitHub account. If you are on the NMFS GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you will also need to be logged in using SSO.\n\n\nStep 2: Open GitHub Desktop and clone a repository\nOn your local computer, open GitHub Desktop. Click “Clone a repository from the Internet…”\n\nClick “Sign in” and “Continue with browser” to open a browser window and sign into GitHub Desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantWhen logging into GitHub Desktop for the first time, you will be presented with a tabbed window as shown below. To access GitHub Enterprise, do not use the Enterprise tab on the login window! This is for a locally-hosted GitHub Enterprise server. The NMFS GitHub Enterprise is cloud-hosted, so to access enterprise repositories from GitHub Desktop, you will need to be logged into the enterprise (via SSO) through your browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the name of the GitHub Skills repository we just finished (skills-introduction-to-github) into the search box. Select the repository, choose where to clone the repository to on your local machine, and click “Clone”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhere should you clone your repository to?\n\n\n\nFor transient repositories (i.e., repositories that you only plan to work on briefly or occasionally), I suggest creating a folder on your local file system just for these GitHub repositories. If you’re working on a project and already have a file folder structure for that project, you can clone and/or create your repository inside the existing folder structure.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a new repository\nClick the dropdown where it says “Current repository” in the upper left corner of GitHub Desktop. This will bring up a list of your repositories available on your local machine. For those who are new to GitHub Desktop, this should only include our GitHub Skills repository. Click the “Add” dropdown menu, and click “Create new repository…”\n\nThere are several aspects of a repository you will need to keep in mind when creating a new one from scratch:\n\nName: Make your name distinct and descriptive, but not too long. Don’t use spaces (remember, this will be included as part of the URL). Git and GitHub repositories often use kebab case.\nDescription:Add a brief description to your repository that describes its purpose\nLocal path: Similarly to when you clone a repository into a folder, you need to tell GitHub Desktop where to start a new repository. This will autofill to the directory you specified when installing GitHub Desktop for the first time, but you are welcome to change it to wherever you want your repository stored on your local computer. You can always move a repository after creation.\nREADME file: It is always a good idea to initialize the repository with a README file. This file will serve as the “front page” of your repository on GitHub. You can add a more detailed description of the repository, what it will be used for, instructions for how it should be used by others, etc. If your repository contains datasets, you can also use the README to add metadata. See this link for more information on README files.\nGit ignore: A .gitignore file tells Git what files and folders to not track. These files will still reside on your local repository, but will not be included in a Commit action or accessible on GitHub. Typically, these files are system files for the coding language or IDE you’re using, but can also include files that you don’t want to be shown on GitHub. This may include things like data files that are too big or too sensitive to be hosted on GitHub, code files that include sensitive material, and scratch or intermediate files. When creating a new repository, you can choose to pre-populate the .gitignore file based on the primary coding language you expect to use most in the repository.\nLicense: Any public-hosted GitHub repository should contain a license for open source use. The latest NOAA recommendation is to use Apache License 2.0\n\nGo ahead and fill in the fields and Create your repository.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Publish your repository to GitHub\nAfter creating your repository, GitHub Desktop will open it automatically. However, at this point your repository is only available on your local machine. Go ahead and click the button to publish your repository to GitHub.\n\nYou can choose whether to keep your repository private or let it be viewed by the public. You can also choose to publish the repo to your personal account, or to an organization (e.g., your center’s Enterprise account). In general, for the sake of open science we normally suggest keeping a repository public unless it contains sensitive or proprietary data. For now, we’ll keep this practice repo public.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Modify the README file in your repository\nYou can now open your repository in an editor or IDE (e.g., RStudio), show the files in a file explorer window, or view the repository on GitHub. We will take advantage of the ability to open the repo in the editor to make a change to our repository’s README file.\nOpen your repository in whatever editor you choose (I have mine configured to use RStudio) by clicking the button in GitHub Desktop.\n\nIn your editor, open the README.md file. You will notice that the README file is prepopulated with the title of your repository as a first-level header and your brief description. Make a change to your README file (maybe change the title and add a bit more context to the description), and save your changes. Close your editing program.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Commit your changes\nIn GitHub Desktop, you will notice that the README.md file has now been added to the “Changed files” list on the left-hand side, and the changes are shown in the main pane as a series of deletions and additions. The check-marks indicate that those changes are staged and should be included in the commit. If you change your mind and don’t want a change to be committed, you can click the check mark and it will change to an “unstaged” state. For now, leave all changes staged.\n\nIn the bottom left, you will see a box for your commit message and a description. These allow you to describe the changes made in a particular commit. A more descriptive message can help others (and future you) to understand why you made a particular change. GitHub Desktop will prepopulate the message field if you’re only modifying one file, but it’s often a good idea to change this to something more descriptive. You can go into more details in the description field if necessary, but this is optional.\nChange your commit file, and commit to the “main” branch.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Push your commit to GitHub\nAfter you commit your changes, GitHub Desktop will prompt you to “Push commits to the origin remote”. This is how we will get our local changes up on GitHub. Click the “Push origin” button.\n\nOpen the repository in GitHub in your browser to see what the changes we made to our README look like on GitHub.",

    "text": "Tutorial: Forking a repository\nFor this tutorial, we’re going to be forking a demo repository (https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/GitHub-Clinic-demos), editing our forked copies, and creating a pull request to contribute back to the main repository. Follow along on your own account.\n\nStep 1: Fork the repository\n\nOpen the demo repository in GitHub.\n\nAt the top of the repository, click the Fork button\n\nKeep everything default (your account should be listed under Owner, and the Repository name should be pre-filled for you). Click the green Create Fork button.\n\nYou now have a copy of the original repository in your account. Note that the fork is still connected to the parent repository, so when a change is made to the parent, you can sync it to your fork\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add content to your forked repository\nWe’re going to add a recipe to our forked repository. You can add whatever recipe you’d like, with as many details as you’d like; for this demonstration, we’ll keep it simple (we’ve provided a more detailed chocolate chip recipe as an example to start out).\n\nClick on the recipes folder in the file tree of your forked repository, click the Add file dropdown, and click “Create new file”\n\nName your recipe file, and make sure it ends in .md. We’re making a markdown file here, so we need the .md file extension.\n\nEnter your recipe into the file contents. Remember that we can use markdown formatting here; let’s take advantage of that by adding a title and a couple headings for ## Ingredients and ## Instructions.\nCommit your changes to the main branch of your repository.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Contribute your recipe to the parent repository\n\nOpen the Contribute drop-down on the repository, and click the green Open pull request button to contribute this recipe back to the parent repository.\n\nYour Pull Request (PR) will auto-populate the title with your commit message. You can edit this if you want, or add an extended description. Generally the more descriptive the better, especially if you’re fixing a bug or adding a feature to another repository. For now, we can be brief. Add a description, and click Create pull request\n\nOnce you create the PR, you’ll be brought to the PR on the parent repository. Note that if you do not have write permission on the parent repository, you will not have the option to merge the pull request. But if you do, you can review the pull request and merge it in if everything looks good!\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Sync changes from parent to your fork\nIf a change was made to the parent repository, you can sync that change to your forked repository. For this demo, I added the number of cookies that are made to the chocolate chip cookie recipe (on the main nfms-opensci repository). Let’s see how we can integrate that change to our fork.\n\n\nNavigate to your forked repository.\n\nNotice that the repository notifies you of the number of commits ahead of the parent and behind the parent your fork is. In that same message box, click the Sync fork dropdown, and click Update branch. Note that if you have commits that have not been merged into the parent, you can either discard your commit before the merge (so your fork matches the parent) or keep it and merge the changes from the parent into your fork.\n\nTo verify that your merge worked, click the Sync fork dropdown again. If everything worked, you should have a message that your branch is not behind the upstream (parent) repository",

Follow along with the tutorial using your personal GitHub account.\n\nStep 1: Start the course\nOpen the GitHub Skills link, and make sure you are logged into GitHub. Use the “Start course” button to make a new repository on your account:\n\nWhen you open up the “Start course” link, you will be presented with the “Create a new repository” interface. Keep all of the defaults, and click the green “Create repository” button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantGitHub Skills tutorials use GitHub Actions in the background.\n\n\n\nThese actions use “minutes”, which are limited in a private repository, but unlimited in a public one. We suggest keeping your GitHub Skills tutorial repositories public to avoid any minutes limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipYou’ll notice that most steps in a GitHub Skills tutorial feature a message to wait about 20 seconds for the exercise to update.\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions can take a little bit of time to run, so waiting this requisite time is important! Refresh the instructions after 20 seconds to make sure everything updates properly.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Start the exercise\nAfter waiting the suggested 20 seconds, refresh the repository, and click the “Go to Exercise” button in the README\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI suggest moving the instructions tab into another window so you can work side-by-side with the instructions to limit switching back and forth between tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Follow the exercise\n\nCreate a workflow file\n\nWe’re going to make a new pull request where we will be making our change during the exercises. Navigate to the Pull Requests tab, click New pull request, and change the compare branch to welcome-workflow. Click the green Create pull request button, and confirm the pull request by clicking Create pull request again.\n\nNavigate to the Code tab, and switch to the welcome-workflow branch where it says main.\n\nIn the Code tab, select the .github folder, and navigate to the workflows subfolder. Use the Create new file button to add a new file to this folder.\n\nName your new file welcome.yml, and copy in the YAML code from the tutorial code block into the file contents. Commit your changes to the welcome-workflow branch to save your changes.\n\nWait about 20 seconds for the tutorial to update, then refresh the instructions page.\n\n\n\nAdd a job to your workflow file\nLet’s specify a job to run on our GitHub Action workflow file.\n\nOpen the welcome.yml file that we just created (note that this is different from the 0-welcome.yml file that was provided with the repository at the start of the exercise). Click the Edit button, and copy in the contents from the exercise instructions.\n\nCommit the changes directly to the welcome-workflow branch.\n\nWait about 20 seconds for the tutorial to update, then refresh the instructions page.\n\n\n\nAdd a step to the workflow file\nWe added a job to our workflow file, but at this point the job doesn’t really do anything. Let’s change that by adding a step to our job. This step will use the GitHub Command Line Interface (gh) to add a comment to a pull request when it is first opened. The step also sets some important environment variables that are required for our job to run.\n\nIn the same welcome.yml file (your browser should still be on the file after you committed the last edit), click the Edit button again. Paste in the updated YAML code from the exercise instructions.\n\nCommit your changes directly to the welcome-workflow branch.\n\nWait about 20 seconds for the tutorial to update, then refresh the instructions page.\n\n\n\nMerge your workflow file\nAll of the changes that we’ve made have been on a separate branch so we avoid editing the main branch before the Action is ready for primetime. Let’s merge our changes from the welcome-workflow branch into the main branch.\n\nNavigate to the Pull requests tab, and click on the “Welcome workflow” pull request we created previously.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the pull request (note the various commits that we have made and that the GitHub Skills actions have made) and click Merge pull request, then Confirm merge.\n\nDelete the welcome-workflow branch, wait about 20 seconds for the tutorial to update, then refresh the instructions page.\n\n\n\nTrigger the workflow\nNow that we’ve merged our workflow into our main branch, let’s test it out by opening a pull request.\n\nMake a new branch named test-workflow from the Code tab.\n\nMake a change to the README file by clicking the Edit file button on the README. It doesn’t matter what change you make. In this example, we added an exclamation point to the title header.\n\nCommit your changes directly to your new branch.\n\nIn the Pull requests tab, create a pull request merging test-workflow into main.\n\nWatch our Welcome Workflow running in the checks section of the pull request.\n\nNotice the comment that the workflow adds to the pull request.\n\nWait about 20 seconds, then refresh the instructions page to finish the tutorial.",

    "text": "Tutorial: Making and merging a branch\nFor this tutorial, we’re going to be forking a demo repository (https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/GitHub-Clinic-demos), making a branch on our forked copies, editing our forked copies, and creating a pull request to contribute back to the main branch. Follow along on your own account.\n\nStep 1: Fork the repository\n\nOpen the demo repository in GitHub.\n\nAt the top of the repository, click the Fork button\n\nKeep everything default (your account should be listed under Owner, and the Repository name should be pre-filled for you). Click the green Create Fork button.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create a new branch\n\nOn the Code tab of your forked repository, click the dropdown menu where it says main\nIn the text box where it says “Find or create a branch”, type the name of your branch. Let’s call it tutorial. Click the Create branch tutorial from main button to create your branch.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add content to your new branch\n\nLet’s add a new file to our repository. Click the Add file (+) drop-down menu, and click Create new file.\n\nName your file intro.md and add some content to your file. If you’d like, you can copy the following markdown chunk and paste it into your file.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThis repository serves as a sandbox demo for the NOAA Fisheries GitHub Clinic. Feel free to fork this repository and use it to practice Git and GitHub tools and methods.\n\nCommit your changes to the tutorial branch.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create a pull request\n\nClick the Pull requests tab at the top of the repository. GitHub should recognize that you made a push to your tutorial branch. Click the green Compare & pull request button to start a pull request to merge the pushes from tutorial into main.\n\nNotice that because we’re working from a forked repository, GitHub will automatically fill in the parent repository (nmfs-opensci/GitHub-Clinic-demos) as the repository to merge into. For this tutorial, we instead will merge into the main branch of our forked copy of the repository. Click the drop-down menu where it says “base repository:” and select your forked copy.\n\nGitHub will pre-populate the title of our pull request based on the commit message. If we have multiple commits, we would need to make our own pull request title. Make sure the title is clear and concise, and add a detailed blurb to the description section. For our example, this can be as simple as describing the intent of the pull request. For more complex pull requests that involve adding to or modifying code and text in multiple files, we want to guide the reviewer through your changes as much as possible. Be as detailed as you need to be to convey the changes that were made and why they were made. You can even add images, screenshots, videos, and links to showcase how the changes you made are reflected for the end user.\n\nClick the green Create pull request button to finalize our pull request.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Review and merge your pull request\nReviewing a pull request is an important step of the collaborative process on GitHub. Pull request reviews allow the owner of a repository or another collaborator to read through changes line-by-line, adding comments and proposing edits along the way. Think of a pull request review as being similar to a manuscript or report review using track changes.\nBefore we merge our changes into our main branch, let’s get some practice with reviewing pull requests. This step is not as important when you’re the only one working on a repository (like in our tutorial), but it’s good practice for future collaborations.\n\nAssign yourself as a reviewer to the pull request using the Assignees dropdown on the right-hand side of your pull request. In a collaborative setting, you can assign up to 10 of your collaborators.\n\nNavigate to the Files changed pane in the pull request. This is where we’ll conduct our review.\n\nJust like in a manuscript peer review, we can leave a narrative review with general comments and recommendations, and we can also add comments and propose edits to specific lines. Let’s add a comment to change the first-level heading of our markdown file. Hover your mouse in the space between the line numbers and the content. You’ll see a highlighted + icon appear next to each line. Click the + icon next to line 1.\n\nThis will open up a dialog box where we can add a comment or suggest a change to this specific line. Lets suggest a change to the heading name. Click the icon next to the Preview tab. This icon is the Add a suggestion icon. Notice that when you click this icon, it inserts a code snippet into our dialog box with the label suggestion. Inside this code snippet, suggest a change to the # Introduction header to read # Purpose of this repository.\n\nFrom here, we can either add our suggestion as a single comment to the pull request conversation, or start a review based on this suggestion. Let’s go ahead and click the green Start a review button.\nFrom here, we can add more line-by-line comments and suggestions, or we can finish our review with our general impressions. Let’s click the green Finish your review button (notice there is a ticker that tracks the number of line-by-line comments/suggestions).\n\nAdd a comment to your review summarizing your comments and changes and giving overall impressions. Click the green Submit review button to finalize your review.\n\nAs the original creator of the pull request, you can now commit the proposed change directly to the pull request, continue the conversation to refine the suggestion, or decline the suggestion and Resolve the conversation. Let’s commit the proposed change from the pull request review.\n\nOnce your change has been committed, we’re ready to merge the pull request! Click the green Merge pull request button, and confirm your merge with a merge commit.\n\n\nCongratulations! You have merged a pull request from a branch. You can now optionally delete the branch (don’t worry, you can always restore it from the pull request). During the next GitHub Clinic session on Git Workflows, we’ll discuss reasons and scenarios where you may want to keep a permanent branch versus creating and deleting ephemeral branches for development. For now, let’s go ahead and delete our branch to close out this tutorial.",

    "text": "Tutorial: Making a basic landing page from a README file with GitHub Pages\nFor this tutorial, we’re going to be taking a step away from GitHub Skills and creating a basic landing page for a repository using GitHub Pages. Our example is going to be a little boring, but a basic README-based landing page can be formatted to look great! Here’s an example from NMFS Open Science of a formatted README-based landing page:\n\n\nStep 1: Create a new repository\n\nOn the GitHub home page, click the + in the upper right corner of, and select New repository.\n\nName your repository “github-pages”, and make sure to check the Add a README file box. Make your repository public (you’ll need to do this to enable GitHub Pages), and create your repository.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Enable GitHub Pages\n\nNavigate to the Settings tab of your new repository.\n\nOn the left-hand side, select the Pages section under Code and automation\n\nUnder Source, make sure “Deploy from a branch” is selected (it should be the default). Under Branch, click the drop-down where it says “None” and select “main”.\n\nThis will add an additional drop-down to select the directory that GitHub will look for your content. For more complex websites, we can change this to point to a different directory where all of our HTML content will be rendered. For a simple README-based landing page, we can leave this as it’s default / (root). This points to the root, or home, directory of your repository where your README file resides.\n\nSave your changes. At this point, a special GitHub Action will spin up in the background to build your GitHub Pages website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can track the progress of your build by navigating to the Actions tab at the top of your repository. Click the “pages build and development” workflow to see what GitHub Actions is doing to build your website.\n\n\n\nOnce your website is built, you can view it by clicking the link in the Actions tab, or you should see a banner at the top of your GitHub Pages settings page with the link to your new website. Click the link and check out your new website!\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Customize our website\nOur website as it currently stands is a little dull. Let’s add a theme and some content to make it a little nicer!\n\nAdd a file to your repository in the root (base) directory called _config.yml.\n\n\n\nIn the file contents, add the following lines:\n\ntitle: GitHub Pages Demo Website\ntheme: jekyll-theme-slate\n\n\nCommit your changes, then edit your README.md file (you can click the edit button on the main page)\n\nChange your first-level heading to a suitable front page title, and add some content\n\nCommit your changes, wait about 30 seconds, and navigate to your website to see what our changes look like when rendered",

    "text": "Tutorial: GitHub Pages x Quarto templates for NMFS-branded websites\nREADME-based webpages can be useful for one-off landing pages, but in general we’ll want to use something a little more complex to build a webpage. There are many open-source webpage applications to create a website using GitHub Pages. Quarto, which is a Markdown-based publishing software, is a particularly powerful tool for creating a website. However, building a Quarto website from scratch can be tedious.\nThankfully, Quarto and GitHub make it easy to create and share templates for GitHub Pages sites, many of which are plug-and-play; simply add your own content (or replace the current content with your own), and you’re up and running with a clean, themed, feature-rich website! NMFS Open Science provides several templates to create a NOAA Fisheries-themed website. Let’s use one of these to create a more complex website.\n\nStep 1: Copy a Quarto website template to your GitHub\nWe’re going to use the NOAA-quarto-simple template to create our website. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the green Use this template button. Select “Create a new repository”.\n\nOn the Create a new repository page, make sure the check-box next to “Include all branches” is selected (GitHub Pages is set up to deploy from the gh-pages branch, so we need all branches to be copied over to our version of the repository). Give your repository a name (make sure your account is selected as the Owner), and make sure the repository is set to public. Click the green Create repository button to copy the template to your GitHub.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Configure GitHub Actions\nIf you’ll recall from the slides, Quarto files need to be rendered to HTML for GitHub Pages to properly display them as a webpage. The NMFS Open Science Quarto website templates use GitHub Actions, an automation tool provided by GitHub, to automatically render these files to HTML (and push them to the gh-pages branch from where GitHub Pages is set to deploy). We need to make sure that these actions have the proper permissions to write to our repository.\nIn the Settings tab of your repository, click the dropdown under the Actions section on the left-hand side and select the General category.\n\nScroll to the bottom of this section, and under the Workflow permissions heading, select the option for Read and write permissions. Save your changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA GitHub Actions workflow began when we initially made our repository. You may receive a notification that the Action failed when it finishes running. That’s okay. As long as we have this Workflow permissions option configured, the GitHub Action workflow should succeed the next time we commit to our repository.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Verify that GitHub Pages is building your site\nNavigate to the Pages section of the Settings tab on your newly-created repository. Previously, we built our website from the main branch. In this case, we’re building from a separate, dedicated gh-pages branch (still at the root of that branch).\n\nVerify that your site is live by clicking the link in GitHub Pages.\n\nTo broadcast that your website is up and running (and provide a more convenient location to access the site URL), we can add a link to the website to our repository home page. On your repository home page, click the gear icon for the About section, click the checkbox next to “Use your GitHub Pages website” under the Website header, and save your changes.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Edit your new website\nTo make changes to your new website, navigate to the Code tab of the repository, and select the content folder of the main branch. Here, you’ll have several markdown files that you can edit to your heart’s content!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you make changes to the file names, you’ll need to make corresponding changes to the _quarto.yml file. This is more advanced, and a bit outside of the scope of our tutorial, but I encourage you to check out the Websites and books section of the R for Data Science ebook to learn more.",

Follow along on your own account.\n\nStep 1: Fork the repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipIf you have already forked this repository for a previous session, you can skip this step.\n\n\n\nWe have used this demo repository for previous GitHub Clinic demonstrations and tutorials, so you may already have a forked copy of this repository on your account. If you are unsure, you can search for [your-username]/GitHub-Clinic-demos in the GitHub search bar.\n\n\n\nOpen the demo repository in GitHub.\n\nAt the top of the repository, click the Fork button.\n\nKeep everything default (your account should be listed under Owner, and the Repository name should be pre-filled for you). Click the green Create Fork button.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Enable Issues and Discussions\nWhen you create your new fork, you may notice that the Issues and Discussions tabs that you normally see at the top of the repository are not there. We have to enable these in the repository settings.\n\nNavigate to the Settings tab in your forked repository.\n\nOn the main settings page, scroll down to the Features section, and select the checkboxes next to Issues and Discussions.\n\nNote that the top menu bar for your repository now has the Issues and Discussions tabs added.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Set up a template issue\n\nRefresh the settings page, and in the same Features section, click the green Set up templates button under Issues.\n\nUnder the dropdown menu for Add template, select Bug report to add a Bug report template to your available templates.\n\nClick the Preview and edit button to see what your issue template looks like in Markdown\n\nLet’s go ahead and edit the template to take out the part about smartphone specifications. Click the edit button at the top next to “Issue: Bug report” (it looks like a little pencil).\n\nIn the Template content section, scroll down to the “Smartphone” section, and delete everything from that section.\n\nClick the “x” at the top of the editing pane to save your changes, then click the Close preview button. Click the green Propose changes button to create a commit that will add your new template to your repository.\n\nNote that you now have a new subfolder in your repository under the .github folder called ISSUE_TEMPLATE. If you navigate to that folder in your repository, you can see our newly created bug_report.md template. If we ever want to make more edits to our template, we can either use the template editor interface in the Settings menu, or we can directly edit these files in our repository.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create an issue\n\nNavigate to the Issues tab in your repository, and click the green New issue button.\n\nLet’s use the new template that we created. Click the Bug report option in the menu.\n\nGive your issue a title and fill in the template with a fake “bug”. Note that you can directly paste in an image from your clipboard (GitHub converts it to a permalink when you paste it into Markdown). Click the green Create button to submit your issue.\n\nLet’s add a label to our Issue to show that it’s a bug report. On the left-hand side of the issue, click the “Labels” section and select “bug”.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Start a discussion\nOur bug report has spawned some discussion among the developers! Let’s document this discussion in our repository.\n\nNavigate to the Discussions tab in your repository, and click New Discussion.\n\nLet’s make this a general discussion. Click the green Get started button in the area next to General.\n\nAdd a title and a body to your discussion thread. We can reference the issue that we created earlier using the # key.\n\nClick the green Start discussion button to save your discussion thread.\n\nCongratulations! You have now added both an Issue and a Discussion topic to your repository. Feel free to play around with other Issues templates and Discussion types on your own.",

The following tutorial follows the updated issue-based workflow. If you began this exercise before 5-30-2025, your skills repository will look different from the current skills repository template. If this is the case, click here for the legacy README-based tutorial.\n\n\nGitHub Skills: Communicate using markdown\nWe’ll be using the Communicate Using Markdown Skills Tutorial to get some practice with markdown in GitHub. Follow along with the tutorial using your own GitHub account.\n\nStep 1: Copy the exercise\nOpen the GitHub Skills link, and make sure you are logged into GitHub. Use the “Copy Exercise” button to make a new repository on your account:\nWhen you open up the “Copy Exercise” link, you will be presented with the “Create a new repository” interface. Keep all of the defaults, and click the green “Create repository” button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantGitHub Skills tutorials use GitHub Actions in the background.\n\n\n\nThese actions use “minutes”, which are limited in a private repository, but unlimited in a public one. We suggest keeping your GitHub Skills tutorial repositories public to avoid any minutes limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipYou’ll notice that most steps in a GitHub Skills tutorial feature a message to wait about 20 seconds for the exercise to update.\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions can take a little bit of time to run, so waiting this requisite time is important! Refresh the instructions after 20 seconds to make sure everything updates properly.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Start the exercise\nAfter waiting the suggested 20 seconds, refresh the repository, and click the “Go to Exercise” button in the README\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI suggest moving the instructions tab into another window so you can work side-by-side with the instructions to limit switching back and forth between tabs. \n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Follow the exercise\n\nCreate a markdown file in a new branch\nIn this exercise, we will be using markdown to create an example “blog” page. The content provided in the exercise is just an example; we can give a more personal touch to our own content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDuring this tutorial, GitHub Skills will provide code blocks that you can copy directly to your clipboard to paste into the body of your Markdown document. But this defeats the purpose of getting practice with Markdown and building that muscle memory! Go ahead and type in your own content (don’t worry, it doesn’t have to match the example content perfectly)\n\n\n\nOn the Code tab of your repository, click the dropdown menu where it says “main”\n\nIn the “Find or create a branch” box, type start-blog and select “Create branch start-blog from main”\n\nCreate a new file by clicking the “Add file” button in your new branch (note this may look like a + symbol if you’re working in a condensed side-by-side view) and click “Create new file”\n\nAlong the top of the dialogue box, name your file day-1.md\n\nIn your new file, create a level one heading to give the page a title\n\nAdd a couple level 2 headings for the names of each of the blog posts\n\nClick the Preview tab in the top left of the dialogue box to view your rendered content\n\nClick the “Commit changes” button in the top right and commit the changes directly to the start-blog branch\n\n\n\n\nMake a list\n\nRe-open the day-1.md file and click “Edit this file”\n\nIn the ## Morning Planning section, add a list of each type: unordered, ordered, and task\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGitHub skills only asks for a task list, but we want you to have practice with all list types; adding the other types will not mess up the GitHub Skills workflow, so go ahead and practice adding all three types!\n\n\n\nPreview your content in the preview tab\n\nCommit your changes directly to the start-blog branch\n\n\n\n\nAdd a code sample\n\nAfter this commit, the day-1.md file should still be open. Click the “Edit this content” button to go back into editing mode\n\nIn the “Review” section, add a code chunk using the three backtick notation (it’s okay to use a different example than the one provided by GitHub Skills)\n\nPreview your content\n\nCommit your changes to the start-blog branch\n\n\n\n\nAdd an image\n\nOpen our day-1.md file in edit mode\n\nInsert an image below the the “Morning Planning” level 2 heading. To make things a little more interesting, let’s use the Scubatocat image located at https://octodex.github.com/images/scubatocat.png\n\nPreview your Markdown file\n\nGo back to the Edit tab and replace the image with an HTML version that changes the size and position\n\nPreview your updated image, and Commit changes to start-blog\n\n\n\nAdd some formatted text (off-script)\nBefore we finish up our tutorial, let’s add some formatted text. The GitHub Skills lesson does not mention anything about this, but it’s an important part of markdown that you should get some practice with!\n\nEdit your day-1.md file one more time\n\nUnder the Daily Learning heading, add some bolded, italicized, and in-line code text\n\nPreview your file, then commit your changes\n\n\n\n\nFinish work: Merge your blog post\nThis step doesn’t have anything to do with markdown, but it’s good practice for working with Pull Requests from a branch!\n\nSelect the “Pull requests” tab in the top navigation bar\n\nClick the “Compare & pull request” button for start-blog\n\nClick the “Create pull request button”\n\nMerge your pull request and confirm the merge",

We will add some issues to our Project, and explore different project views and customization options to tailor our Projects to our specific needs. Follow along on your own account.\n\nStep 1: Fork the repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipIf you have already forked this repository for a previous session, you can skip this step.\n\n\n\nWe have used this demo repository for previous GitHub Clinic demonstrations and tutorials, so you may already have a forked copy of this repository on your account. If you are unsure, you can search for [your-username]/GitHub-Clinic-demos in the GitHub search bar.\n\n\n\nOpen the demo repository in GitHub.\n\nAt the top of the repository, click the Fork button.\n\nKeep everything default (your account should be listed under Owner, and the Repository name should be pre-filled for you). Click the green Create Fork button.\n\nWhen you create your new fork, you may notice that the Issues tab that you normally see at the top of the repository is not there. We have to enable this in the repository settings. Navigate to the Settings tab in your forked repository. Scroll down to the Features section and check the box next to Issues. (Note that Projects is another option in the Features section; this should already be checked, but if it isn’t, go ahead and check that as well).\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create a new Project\nThere are multiple ways to create projects in GitHub. Rather than being attached to one specific repository, Projects can act across any and all repositories in an account. Because of this functionality, Projects reside in either a user’s account or an organization’s account, rather than within a repository. We’re going to be creating a Project using the Projects tab within a repository, but keep in mind that we can access all of our Projects from our account home page.\n\nNavigate to the Projects tab on the top ribbon bar of your repository. Click the green New project button to start a new project.\n\nYou will be presented with a number of pre-defined Project templates, each of which has a specific layout and customized configuration tailored to the type of planning or tracking your team may use. Feel free to explore these on your own; for now, let’s start a project from scratch. On the left-hand side of the pop-up, select the Table option under Start from scratch.\n\nGive your new Project a name. Let’s call ours “GitHub Clinic example project”. Click the green Create project button to finalize your new project.\n\nLet’s add a description and README to our project to describe our Project’s purpose. Click the ellipse button (View more options) at the top right of the project, and select Settings.\n\nAdd a short description and README to the Project to explain the purpose of the Project and how to use it. Note that the README supports markdown formatting. In future Projects, you may want to take advantage of this to flesh out the details of your Project and add more context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGitHub Projects default to Private visibility.\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that there’s a padlock-style icon next to the title of our Project. This means that the Project is private, so only you and the people you specifically grant access can see the Project. We can change the visibility in this Settings menu as well. Sometimes it’s beneficial to make Projects publicly viewable for transparency purposes; otherwise, feel free to keep these Projects private. You can always add collaborators later.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Add items to your project\nLet’s populate our Project with some issues! We can add existing issues from any repository in the account (individual or organization) that the Project was created under. We can also create our own issues directly from the Project interface.\n\n\nLet’s create a few example issues for our Project. Click the + button on the first line of the Project board, and click “Create new issue”. This will pop up a dialogue box where we can add an issue to a repository. We’ll create our issues in the GitHub Clinic Demo repository, so make sure the Repository section has the appropriate repository selected (Hint: click the Repository dropdown menu and type “github-clinic-demos” in the search box).\n\nI’ve added some Issue templates for Bug report, Feature request, and Task to the demos repository that should transfer to your forked repository. Let’s add one of each type to our Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipYou may need to pull changes from the parent repository to get the appropriate templates.\n\n\n\nIf you are working from a previously forked copy of the GitHub-Clinic-Demos repository, you will need to update your version of the repository with the parent repository hosted on nmfs-opensci. On the Code tab of your forked copy of the repository, there will be a banner saying your branch is behind the branch hosted on nmfs-opensci. Next to this banner, there should be a button called Sync fork. Go ahead and click that button, and select Update branch.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add “draft” issues to our Project. These can be used as placeholders for items that may need to be more fleshed out or items that we don’t necessarily need as true “issues” in a specific repository. Click in the Title spot below the last project item, and type in a draft issue.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Adding fields\nLet’s create some custom fields to better organize our project.\n\nIteration fields let us plan and track our work over repeating blocks of time. Iterations can be configured with customizable lengths and breaks to suit your team’s needs. Create an iteration field by clicking the + icon to the right of the Status column in our table view, and click “New field”. Give your field a name, and change the field type to Iteration. You can customize when the iteration should start and how long each iteration should last.\n\nAssign each of your Project items to an iteration. This will be useful when we explore the Roadmap layout later.\n\nLet’s create a Priority field. Click the + icon to the right of the Iteration column in our table view, and click “New field”. Name your field Priority, and select “Single select” from the field type menu. Add options for Low, Medium, and High priority. Save your new field.\n\nAssign each of your example issues to a priority level in your new field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Configure the Table layout\nLet’s make this table a little more informative by adding some other fields.\n\nClick the dropdown where it says View 1, and select the Fields menu. Under “Hidden fields”, select Labels, Milestone, and Repository.\n\nIn the same dropdown, select the Group by option and select Priority to split the table by priority.\n\nWith the grouped view, we can now move items between priorities. Try this out by moving one of your items from medium to low priority. Do this by clicking and dragging from the number to the left of the issue title.\n\n\nChange the name of your view by clicking the drop-down menu again and selecting Rename view. Let’s rename it to “Planning”.\n\nSave your changes to the view by clicking the green Save option in the dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionBe sure to save your view if you want to come back to it!\n\n\n\nViews do not save to the project by default. If you make changes to a view that you want to be shown every time you open your project, be sure to save them. Otherwise, view changes will only be applied during the current session.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Experiment with other views\nLet’s create a couple new views to showcase the other view types. You’re welcome to play around with these views on your own, but for now we’ll just introduce the other view types.\n\nCreate a new view by clicking the + New view tab at the top of the project. Select the Board option.\n\nRename this view to “Progress Board”, and click the green Save button to save your view. Here we can move issues between different categories. The default is a traditional kanban-style board with statuses for level of completeness. However, we can also add different categories to assign and organize issues to whatever is needed. We can even add multiple versions of these boards to categorize items in different ways.\n\nNow let’s add a timeline view. Select + New view at the top of the project, and select the Roadmap option.\n\nGitHub will prompt us that we need a date field set for this view. Recall that we set up an Iteration field earlier in the exercise called Weekly deadline. Choose the Weekly deadline start option for the Start date and Weekly deadline end option for the Target date.\n\nRename this view to Timeline and save your view.\n\nFeel free to experiment with the different view types and features available with Projects. Check out GitHub’s documentation for Projects (be sure to look at the different sub-pages on the right-hand side of the page) for more information, tips, and tricks about GitHub Projects.",

    "text": "Tutorial: Practice with Workflows\nGitHub Skills: Create a release-based workflow\nWe’ll be using the Create a Release-based Workflow Skills Tutorial to practice using a GitHub Flow-style workflow with releases. Follow along with the tutorial using your own GitHub account.\n\nStep 1: Start the course\nOpen the GitHub Skills link, and make sure you are logged into GitHub. Use the “Start course” button to make a new repository on your account:\n\nWhen you open up the “Star” link, you will be presented with the “Create a new repository” interface. Keep all of the defaults, and click the green “Create repository” button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantGitHub Skills tutorials use GitHub Actions in the background.\n\n\n\nThese actions use “minutes”, which are limited in a private repository, but unlimited in a public one. We suggest keeping your GitHub Skills tutorial repositories public to avoid any minutes limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipYou’ll notice that most steps in a GitHub Skills tutorial feature a message to wait about 20 seconds for the exercise to update.\n\n\n\nGitHub Actions can take a little bit of time to run, so waiting this requisite time is important! Refresh the instructions after 20 seconds to make sure everything updates properly.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Start the exercise\nAfter waiting the suggested 20 seconds, refresh the repository, and click the “Go to Exercise” button in the README\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI suggest moving the instructions tab into another window so you can work side-by-side with the instructions to limit switching back and forth between tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Follow the exercise\n\nCreate a beta release\nIn this exercise, we will be creating a release-based workflow that is built on the foundations of GitHub flow.\n\nGo to the Releases page for the repository. If you are in a condensed view mode, this link will be at the bottom of the Code page. If you’re viewing in a full-sized window, this page will be in the sidebar on the right-hand side of the repository window on the Code page.\n\nClick the green Create a new release button to start a new new release\n\nClick the Tag: Select tag dropdown, and specify a release number. Use v0.9 for this example. Click Create new tag: v0.9 on publish.\n\nGive the release a title, and an optional short description. Check the box next to Set as a pre-release.\n\nClick the green Publish release button to finalize your pre-release.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduce a bug to be fixed later\nNext, we’ll add a bug to our code that will be fixed later in this tutorial.\n\nAt the top of the repository, click on the Pull requests tab and click the green New button (if you’re in the full window view, this will say New pull request).\n\nSet the base: dropdown menu to release-v1.0 and the compare: dropdown menu to update-text-colors, and click the green Create pull request button.\nUpdate the pull request title to “Updated game text style”. Optionally add a more detailed description to your pull request. Click the green Create pull request button.\n\nMerge the pull request, wait about 20 seconds for the instructions to refresh, and refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new feature to the release branch\nWe’ll be using the release-v1.0 branch to add features to our repository. We can treat this branch as a long-lived but ephemeral branch in the spirit of GitHub Flow.\n\nIn the Code tab, create a new branch off of the main branch. This will be our “feature” branch. Name your branch feature-background.\n\nOpen the base.css file, and click the “edit this file” button (it should look like a pen in the upper right hand corner of the code chunk. Scroll down to line 109. In the body declaration, add a line that changes the background color to black using the background-color: black; line as shown in the tutorial.\n\nCommit your changes, updating the commit message to be more descriptive.\n\nNavigate to the Pull requests tab, and create a new pull request. Set the base branch to release-v1.0 and the compare branch to feature-background. Click the green Create pull request button, and fill in the pull request template. Click the Create pull request button to finalize the pull request.\n\nMerge the pull request and delete your feature branch.\n\nWait about 20 seconds for GitHub Actions to update, then refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\nOpen a release pull request\nOpening a pull request early in the release can help facilitate discussion about the release. Any commits added to the compare branch after opening the pull request will be associated with that pull request until it’s closed.\n\nIn the Pull requests tab, open a new pull request with base: main and compare: release-v1.0. You can do this from the “release-v1.0 had recent pushes” banner to save time.\n\nAdd some detail to your pull request body description, and click the green Create pull request button. Don’t merge your pull request yet!\n\nWait 20 seconds for GitHub Actions to update, then refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\nGenerate release notes and merge\nYou can generate release notes automatically based on the content of your pull request. Let’s practice this with our “Release v1.0” pull request.\n\nNavigate to the Releases page from the Code tab of your repository (see above if you need a reminder of how to get there).\nClick the Draft a new release button in the top right corner.\n\nIn the Tag: dropdown menu, type v1.0.0, and create a tag with that name. Change the Target: dropdown to select the release-v1.0 branch.\n\nClick the Generate release notes button at the top of the description box.\n\nReview your release notes and make any changes if necessary.\n\nSet the Target: branch back to main (we only needed the release branch to generate our release notes).\n\nClick the Save draft button (not the Publish release button; we’ll publish in the next step).\n\nOpen your Release v1.0 pull request on the Pull requests tab.\n\nMerge your pull request.\n\nWait 20 seconds for the GitHub Actions to update, then refresh the instructions page.\n\n\n\nAn aside on semantic versioning\nThis release workflow uses a system called semantic versioning, which is a convention for specifying compatibility. It uses a three-part version number: major version, minor version, and patch.\n\n\n\nFinalize the release\n\nFrom the Code page, navigate to the Releases page. Click the edit button next to your v1.0.0 release.\n\nEnsure the Target branch is set to main\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page, and click Publish release.\n\nWait 20 seconds for the GitHub actions to update, then refresh the instructions README page.\n\n\n\nCommit a hotfix to the release\nWe can make a short-lived, ephemeral branch to fix a bug. The tutorial has already introduced a bug (we did this in the first part of the tutorial), and created a feature branch (fix-game-background) and a hotfix release branch (hotfix-v1.0.1) for us that fixes the bug. Let’s make a pull request to introduce this bug fix into our repo.\n\nIn the Pull requests tab, open a pull request setting hotfix-v1.0.1 as the base branch and fix-game-background as the compare branch.\n\nAdd a description to the pull request body, and change the title of the pull request to “Hotfix for broken game style”. Create your pull request and merge it into our hotfix-v1.0.1 release branch.\n\nOpen a new pull request with main as the base branch and hotfix-v1.0.1 as the compare branch.\n\nAdd a detailed description to the pull request body.\n\nCreate and merge your pull request into the main branch.\n\nWait 20 seconds for GitHub Actions to update, then refresh the README.\n\n\n\nCreate release v1.0.1\nThe final step is incorporating our hotfix changes into a new release to distribute to the necessary channels.\n\nNavigate to the Releases page from the Code tab, and click the Draft a new release button.\n\nSet the Target branch to main and add a v1.0.1 tag to follow semantic versioning. Click Generate release notes to auto-populate the release title and notes. Review the release notes, and customize if desired.\n\nClick Publish release at the bottom of the page. Wait 20 more seconds for the tutorial README to update, then refresh the instructions.\n\nYou’re finished with the tutorial! Now that you have practiced with a release-based workflow, feel free to experiment with other workflows and select the one that works best for your project and team.",
