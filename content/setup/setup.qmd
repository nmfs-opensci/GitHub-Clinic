2.  [Install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) - Note that this will also install Git on your machine
3.  Request access to NMFS GitHub Enterprise Cloud (NMFS staff and affiliates only)
    a.  [Download the NMFS GitHub Enterprise Cloud user agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yP0mLpD5d5rsgNv5-_Z6OWpwhLROjxMg/view)
    b.  Use [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvWB-gTtQKlFPdyt3Y_H_oya9EW6Nj-56jsWJsxVdT8RJwHw/viewform) to request access to Enterprise
    c.  Wait for follow-up email and [confirm you're a member](https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs) (if you see a 404 page you haven't been added yet)
4.  Log into GitHub and GitHub Desktop using your GitHub account credentials

## Signing up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)

-   Follow the [instructions](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/github-users?pli=1) on the GGT website to request access.

-   Wait to be invited to GHEC and accept

-   Then you can sign in to an org like <https://github.com/noaa-nwfsc> with CAC or password+authentication

## Authenticating to GHEC

### Using GitHub Desktop

1.  Go to GitHub Desktop \> Settings \> Accounts

2.  Sign into GitHub.com. **Ignore GitHub Enterprise!!**

3.  DONE!

**Help! I signed up for GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Desktop will not authenticate!!** Log out of GitHub Desktop under GitHub Desktop \> Settings (or Options) \> Account and log back in.

## Authenticating to GHEC: Using RStudio

### Tell RStudio about Git

1.  In RStudio, Tools \> Terminal \> New Terminal

2.  At the command line (in the new terminal), type `which git` if on a Mac and `where git` if in Windows.

3.  Copy that path.

4.  In RStudio, Tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN There is a box at top that asks for the location of the Git binary.

5.  Paste that path in.

You have to authenticate to GitHub separately for RStudio even if you are signed in on GitHub Desktop.

If you see anything like this, you have not authenticated.
