## Aims and Objectives

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plain-text text documents. GitHub uses markdown for a variety of applications across repositories and projects, including for README files, issues, discussions, commit messages, and comments. This Introduction to Markdown skills session will use a a mixture of directed, interactive lessons and GitHub Skills to provide NOAA Fisheries staff with a foundation in markdown language formatting and editing.
