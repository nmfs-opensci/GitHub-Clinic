## What is Markdown?

-   Lightweight markup language for formatting elements to plain-text text documents

-   Used by GitHub in a variety of places

    -   README files

    -   Issues and comments

    -   Discussions

    -   Commit messages

## Why use Markdown?

-   Lightweight - doesn't balloon file sizes

-   Portable - makes it easy to share formatted documents across platforms

-   Adaptable - Quarto, Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown

-   Ubiquitous - Used across a number of websites and applications

# Markdown basics

## Headings

-   Created using the `#` symbol

-   Number of `#` corresponds to the level of header

## Text styling

-   Bold - **\*\*bold text\*\***

-   Italics - *\*italicized text\**

-   Bold italics - ***\*\*\*bold and italicized text\*\*\****

-   Superscript - superscript^\^2\^^

-   Subscript - superscript~\~2\~~

-   Strikethrough - \~\~~~strikethrough~~\~\~

-   Code (monospace) - \``code`\`

## Code blocks

Code blocks are denoted by a series of three back-ticks:

````         
```
x = 1 + 1
print('Hello, world!')
```
````

```         
x = 1 + 1
print('Hello, world!')
```

You can style code chunks based on the language

````         
``` r
x = 1 + 1
print('Hello, world!')
```
````

``` r
x = 1 + 1
print('Hello, world!')
```
