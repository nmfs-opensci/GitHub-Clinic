## What is a Branch? {auto-animate="true"}

-   Separate workspace where you can make changes and try new ideas without affecting main project

-   Isolated, contained development area

-   Add content to a repository without affecting other code

-   Can be created from any other branch

## Why use branches?

-   Allows multiple users to contribute to project without interfering with each other

-   Fix a bug or add a feature without breaking the main project

-   Experiment with new ideas without affecting the main project

## How are branches different from forks?

-   Housed within the repository, rather than across copies of the repository

-   Collaborating and project management within a team, rather than outside the team

-   Switching between branches changes the repository structure, rather than switching to a different repository

## The process of branching {auto-animate="true"}

::: incremental
1.  Create a branch on a repository you have write access to
2.  Make and commit your changes, making commits along the way if necessary
3.  If necessary/desired, sync any changes made from the main branch to your branch
4.  Create a pull request to contribute your changes back to the parent repository
5.  Resolve merge conflicts, if necessary

## Things to keep in mind when branching

-   Branches can be ephemeral or permanent

-   Branches can have separate read/write access from each other

## Pull requests

-   Proposal to merge changes from a branch (or fork) into another

-   Slight misnomer; "pull" is more like "push" or "merge" in this respect

-   Initiates a conversation between the requester and collaborators

-   Review and discuss changes prior to merging
