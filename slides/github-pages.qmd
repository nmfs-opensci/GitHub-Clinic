## How GitHub Pages recognizes content

-   A GitHub Pages "action" runs after every commit

-   Any HTML file in the source directory is indexed and can be linked to

-   Any Markdown file will be rendered and indexed

-   But not Quarto...

    -   Need to render to HTML first

    -   GitHub Actions can help us with this
