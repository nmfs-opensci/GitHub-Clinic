## What are GitHub Projects?

-   Adaptable, flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub

-   Spreadsheet, task-board, and roadmap integrated with issues and pull requests

-   Provide multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping issues/PRs

-   Visualize work with configurable charts

-   Add custom fields to track team-specific metadata

## Why use GitHub for project management?

-   Issues and projects stoke collaboration

-   Issues act as short-term to-do lists

-   Projects capture longer-term goals and organize short-term issues

# Customizing Project Views

## Fields (Table and Board layouts)

-   Based on issue metadata

-   In Table view, these add columns to the table to let you view, sort, and filter

-   In Board view, these are shown on each board item

-   Fully customizable

## Grouping (All layouts)

-   Horizontally split issues by certain aspects of an issue (metadata)

## Sorting (All layouts)

-   Sort project issues by issue metadata

-   Multi-field sorting available

-   Can sort ascending or descending

-   Can manually sort by dragging and dropping issues

## Slicing (All layouts)

-   Split issues by metadata fields into subsets of issues

-   More akin to filtering than grouping

## Field sum (Board layout only)

-   Add a count of the number of issues in each section of the board

## Roadmap features

-   Date fields

    -   Used to set start and end dates

    -   Iterations: special date fields for repeating blocks of time

-   Vertical markers

    -   Adds a vertical marker to show iterations, dates, and milestones

-   Zoom level

    -   Change density and zoom level of roadmap: month, quarter, and year

## Filters

-   Add field-based filters to further customize views

-   Can be used for very specific purposes and are saved with each view

-   Combine filters across fields for hyper-specific filtering

## Adding views

-   You can have multiple views in one project

-   Views can be tailored to many different needs through layouts, fields, and filters

-   Views can be temporary for a single session or saved to the project
